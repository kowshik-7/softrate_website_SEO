                    We will approve link requests from these organizations if we decide that: (a) the link would not make us look unfavorably to ourselves or our accredited businesses; (b) the organization does not have any negative records with us; (c) the benefit to us from the visibility of the hyperlink compensates for the absence of Softrate; and (d) the link is in the context of general resource information.
                    
                    These organizations may link to our home page so long as the link: (a) is not in any way deceptive; (b) does not falsely imply sponsorship, endorsement, or approval of the linking party and its products or services; and (c) fits within the context of the linking party’s site.
                    
                    If you are one of the organizations listed in paragraph 2 above and are interested in linking to our website, you must inform us by sending an email to Softrate. Please include your name, your organization name, and contact information, as well as the URL of your site, a list of any URLs from which you intend to link to our website, and a list of the URLs on our site to which you would like to link. Wait 2-3 weeks for a response.

                    By use of the uniform resource locator being linked to; or
                    
                    
                    The use of any other description of our website that is linked to makes sense within the context and format of the content on the linking party’s site.
